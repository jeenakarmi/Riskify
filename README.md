# Riskify - Credit Risk Classification
**Simplify risk, amplify trust!**

## Project Overview
Credit scoring evaluates financial risk in lending decisions. **Riskify** is a machine learning project that classifies credit applicants into **Risky** or **Non-Risky** categories based on their financial and behavioral data.

Using Decision Tree Classifier built with Python and Scikit-Learn, Riskify aims to make lending decisions faster and more accurate using data-driven predictions.

## Features
- **Input Features:**  
  - Income  
  - Age  
  - Loan Amount  
  - Payment Behaviour

- **Model:** Decision Tree Classifier  
- **Dataset:** Synthetic credit score dataset simulating real-world financial data
- You can even generate this dataset yourself from the script available [here](https://github.com/jeenakarmi/Riskify/blob/main/data/dataGenerator.py).

## Performance Metrics
- Accuracy Score  
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
- Confusion Matrix (Visualization of model performance)

## Instruction

Create python virtual environment with name `env` or `myenv`. Other names must be added to the `.gitignore` file so as to not push the environment variable folder to the repository.
